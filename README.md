This repository contains all of my Android Application projects developed using Flutter.

## Installation and Setup
Visit the given links below to setup Flutter:

After you complete setup, check whether Flutter SDK has been added to your path by running
```
flutter doctor
```

This is what you should see, it's fine if you have error for Android Studio or VS Code. 
It'll be fixed as soon as you download either one of those. You can downlod them from the link given below.
